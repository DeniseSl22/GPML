Release planning, ongoing developments and feature requests

Directory "gpml-spectrum" is a variety of GPML files to serve as an acid test for GPML parsing libraries (inspired by [csv-spectrum](https://github.com/maxogden/csv-spectrum)).

The GPML2013b schema was never used in PathVisio-Java, but it more accurately and fully reflects the GPML used from 2013 to 2017 than does the GPML2013a schema. Both the GPML2013a and GPML2013b schemas attempt to describe the exact same GPML.
